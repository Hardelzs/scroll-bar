          Home is a place where people rejoice have fun before coming to school
          to see shege, especially if you are a student of DU, home is a place
          of rest for every DU student or any student going to school so keep
          your house confident and protect your home
        </p>

        <p>
          School is a place where we gathered together, people from different
          places, families, fathers, mothers, child, siblings to teach each
          other what i know that they did not know and what they know that i did
          not know, but if you are a student of DU, there is another definition
          for school, it's a place where your right is been held by a person
          calling himself admin and where you can never share what you know but
          they must implement what they know to you
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="class" id="class">
        <img src="images/class.jpg" alt="" width="350px" height="240px" />
        <p>
          Class is a place or room for learning that's is the place knowledge is
          been passed on to young ones by an authority called teacher or
          lecturer, there's always fun in class and class is never boring cause
          a lot of people are there to cheer you up, but in DU class is a place
          of fear where you have to dress like an onion to go and carry a tag,
          class is still nice in anywhere
        </p>

      <div class="hostel" id="hostel">
        <img src="images/hostel.jpg" alt="" width="350px" height="240px" />
        <p>
          hostel is just like a mini home where you rest after a long class,
          it's located in your various school, but DU hostel is another war
          again
